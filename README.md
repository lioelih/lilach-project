Lilach Project ðŸŒ¸

Lilach is a clientâ€“server flower store management system built as a full-stack Java application. It provides both customer-facing features (catalog, basket, checkout, VIP subscriptions) and management tools (user accounts, orders, reports).

The system uses a JavaFX client with FXML-based views and controllers, and a Java server built on OCSF. Clientâ€“server communication is handled through a unified Msg system, with EventBus managing events in the client. On the backend, Hibernate ORM is used with a MySQL database to handle persistence of users, products, orders, and payments.
